          content="OpenWorld Atlanta seeks to provide engaging 3D and dynamic interfaces to the wealth of data extracted by the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship from historic maps and city directories from post-Civil War Atlanta to 1940. During this reconstruction and post-reconstruction period Atlanta went through many changes and experienced rapid growth due to the influences of new economic investments and the development of heavy rail and the electric streetcar which by the 1940s made way for the commuter automobile which transformed Atlanta into the sprawling landscape it is today. The project utilizes geodatabases of historical geographic features that are appended with information acquired from historical geocoders to create data rich and engaging interfaces for community and educational exploration." />
