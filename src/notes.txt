[x] try to extract layer control functionality to sidebar using original docs


[x] consider putting map and utils in same file, or exporting layers to globally accesible lists to be rendered independently of the map file

chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C:/Chrome dev session" --disable-web-security

[x] for generalizability and performance, consider creating icon font for website instead of using png files

need to figure out how to scroll through the overflowing stories

REFACTOR:
    pull css out of App.css, move it into Js files for each component, that way can use the constants from constants.js
    pull components out, reorganize structure
        stories, objects, galleries, etc
    agree on common quotations, either "" or ''
    agree on common variables, either var or let (prob let)

    three.js for 3d objects maybe

    different uses of buildings:
        A ??? School, church, lumber company, rail company
        B ? Seems to be one house next to a rail yard/trolley shed
        C Commercial - red
        D ? only 9 of these
        F Apartments - brown
        I Industrial - purple
        M ? 'Pulman Company Shops'
        N Institutional? - Blue
        O 
        P 
        R Residential - yellow
        S 
        T

        W 
        X

need to do some code splitting https://create-react-app.dev/docs/code-splitting/
buildings.json has duplicate building IDs, causes issues with colors
