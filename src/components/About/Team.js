            Arya creates, modifies, and configures 3D models using a
            variety of computer modeling, simulation software, and
            geospatial data. In partnership with faculty and ECDS
            staff, Arya prepares aesthetically composed digital media
            through graphic design, image processing, and data
            visualization for use in ECDS-supported digital
            scholarship projects. He also researches and explores new
            methods of visualizing data, including 3D, virtual
            reality, and augmented reality.
