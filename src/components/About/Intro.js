      OpenWorld Atlanta seeks to provide engaging 3D and dynamic
      interfaces to the wealth of data extracted by the Emory Center
      for Digital Scholarship from historic maps and city
      directories from post-Civil War Atlanta to 1940. During this
      reconstruction and post-reconstruction period Atlanta went
      through many changes and experienced rapid growth due to the
      influences of new economic investments and the development of
      heavy rail and the electric streetcar which by the 1940s made
      way for the commuter automobile which transformed Atlanta into
      the sprawling landscape it is today. The project utilizes
      geodatabases of historical geographic features that are
      appended with information acquired from historical geocoders
      to create data rich and engaging interfaces for community and
      educational exploration.
